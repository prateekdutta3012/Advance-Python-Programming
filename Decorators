Decorators
A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of this function without explicitly modifying it. It is a very powerful tool that allows 
to add new functionality to an existing function.
There are 2 kinds of decorators:

Function decoratos
Class decorators
A function is decorated with the @ symbol:

@my_decorator
def my_function():
    pass
Function decorators
In order to understand the decorator pattern, we have to understand that functions in Python are first class objects, which means that – like any other object – they can 
be defined inside another function, passed as argument to another function, or returned from other functions. A decorator is a function that takes another function as 
argument, wraps its behaviour inside an inner function. and returns the wrapped function. As a consequence, the decorated function no has extended functionality!

Decorator function arguments
Note that functools.wraps is a decorator that takes an argument for itself. We can think of this as 2 inner functions, so an inner function within an inner function. To 
make this clearer, we look at another example: A repeat decorator that takes a number as input. Within this function, we have the actual decorator function that wraps 
our function and extends its behaviour within another inner function. In this case, it repeats the input function the given number of times.

Class decorators
We can also use a class as a decorator. Therefore, we have to implement the __call__() method to make our object callable. Class decorators are typically used to 
maintain a state, e.g. here we keep track of the number of times our function is executed. The __call__ method does essentially the same thing as the wrapper() method 
we have seen earlier. It adds some functionality, executes the function, and returns its result. Note that here we use functools.update_wrapper() instead of 
functools.wraps to preserve the information about our function.
