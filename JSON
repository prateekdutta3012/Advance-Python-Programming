JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a leightweight data format for data exchange. In Python you have the built-in json module for encoding and decoding JSON data. Simply import it and you are ready to work with JSON data:

import json
Some advantages of JSON:

JSON exists as a "sequence of bytes" which is very useful in the case we need to transmit (stream) data over a network.
Compared to XML, JSON is much smaller, translating into faster data transfers, and better experiences.
JSON is extremely human-friendly since it is textual, and simultaneously machine-friendly.
