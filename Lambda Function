A lambda function is a small (one line) anonymous function that is defined without a name. A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one 
expression. While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, in Python anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword.

lambda arguments: expression

Lambda functions are used when a simple function is used only once or for a short period in your code. It's most common use is as an argument to higher-order functions 
(functions that takes in other functions as arguments). They are also used along with built-in functions like map(), filter(), reduce().
