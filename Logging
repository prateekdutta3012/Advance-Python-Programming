The logging module in Python is a powerful built-in module so you can quickly add logging to your application.
import logging

Log Level
There are 5 different log levels indicating the serverity of events. By default, the system logs only events with level WARNING and above.

Logging in modules and logger hierarchy
Best practice in your application with multiple modules is to create an internal logger using the __name__ global variable. This will create a logger with the name of 
your module and ensures no name collisions. The logging module creates a hierarchy of loggers, starting with the root logger, and adding the new logger to this hierarchy.
If you then import your module in another module, log messages can be associated with the correct module through the logger name. Note that changing the basicConfig of 
the root logger will also affect the log events of the other (lower) loggers in the hierarchy.
