Create and run processes
You create a process with multiprocessing.Process(). It takes two important arguments:

target: a callable object (function) for this process to be invoked when the process starts
args: the (function) arguments for the target function. This must be a tuple
Start a process with process.start()

Call process.join() to tell the program that it should wait for this process to complete before it continues with the rest of the code.
