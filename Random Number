Python defines a set of functions that are used to generate or manipulate random numbers. This article covers:

the random module
reproduce numbers with random.seed()
create cryptographically strong random numbers with the secrets module
create random nd arrays with numpy.random

The seed generator
With random.seed(), you can make results reproducible, and the chain of calls after random.seed() will produce the same trail of data. The sequence of random numbers 
becomes deterministic, or completely determined by the seed value.
