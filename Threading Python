Create and run threads
You create a thread with threading.Thread(). It takes two important arguments:

target: a callable object (function) for this thread to be invoked when the thread starts
args: the (function) arguments for the target function. This must be a tuple
Start a thread with thread.start()

Call thread.join() to tell the program that it should wait for this thread to complete before it continues with the rest of the code.
